# bonds_zero_rate
Bond price given zero rate curve

When the zero rate curve r(0,t) is given explicitly (defined below in r_zero_rate), 
this program computes the price of the corresponding bond. 
The user inputs the cash flow dates, and the cash flows corresponding to the respective dates.
The vector of dates and cash flows should be introduced separated by a space with return at the end with no space
